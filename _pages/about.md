<img src="/images/clap.png" width="30px" height="30px"> Welcome and thank you for visiting my site! I am currently a PH.D. student in Zhejiang University of Technology. I joined the Data Visualization Group at Zhejiang University of Technology [(ZjutVis)](https://zjutvis.org/) in 2019 and under the supervision of [Prof. Ronghua Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fbvnBG4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Guodao Sun](https://godoorsun.org/). I'm interested in exploring large data using interactive visual analysis. At present, my research focus is developing interactive <strong>visual analytics</strong> approaches for analyzing <strong>vision-language model, images-text, and video data (associated with computer vision)</strong>.                   
üëÄ Please feel free to look around and contact me if you have any comments!
